    <p class="">HeraSpace IUU supports the identification of potential Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing activities.
  
      Combining Copernicus satellite data and multi-mission CMEMS products with vessel positioning, regulatory data and actual fishing data, illegal and unregulated fishing activities can be identified.
      
      Unsustainable fishing, both legal and illegal, is the largest current threat to ocean biodiversity. HeraSpace IUU supports existing and proposed management practices by
      backtracking the origin of the fish and checking declared catch labelling.
      
      Simplifying the reporting process for captains, and by interacting with existing and future management and traceability systems by using compatible standards (FLUX).
      
      Copernicus data will feed our core algorithm, training it so that it learns to recognize fishing vessels “disguised” potentially practicing IUU fishing activities.
      It is a key enabler its fusion within this solution is necessary because it allows to compare the fishing effort in the source location of the catch delivered to Europe predicted by the solution with the realistic captures volume and kind of species which have been delivered in the EU harbour.
      
      HeraSpace IUU by getting value from Copernicus, could identify potential illegal catches by validating size (biomass (fish concentration)) and the kind of species of the declared catch when compared with the realistic fishing grounds conditions of the declared location of the fishing source.
      
      It cross-check the fishing conditions in particular areas from a selected Regional Fisheries Organization and then in the EU the authorities are informed about which are the potential amounts of fish by species in the expected declared areas which could be realistically released into the EU harbours when compared with the AI predictions based on Copernicus EO data (Observation-based positioning data).
      
      So, for example if a vessel comes from Canada and the catch was recorded at 14:00 CEST it should match the predictions produced by our proposed AI system in order to examine the veracity of the catch brought to Europe.</p>
